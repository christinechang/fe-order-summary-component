## My process
 I just built it starting with html and adding classes and ids as I went along. Then I watched the tutorial (mentioned below) to get some hints about some basic things and compare to my approach. 

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Initialize styles by clearing margins, padding and setting boxsizing
- I like css variables (but i already knew that)
- Background image setup example
- Minimize use of tags, i don't always need a div around things
- Overflow hidden for showing the rounded corners of the image (can also just add border radius to upper corners of image)
- Bringing in google font (hadn't done that for a while)
- This code gives all children same style, but not sure if I like this approach.
```css
.container > *
```
- Github previewer for repos! https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/christinechang/fe-order-summary-component/blob/main/index.html AMAZING!


### Continued development

So much to continue learning.  I want to polish my CSS grid, Canvas element, and many libraries.

### Useful resources

- [Free Code Camp Basic HTML/CSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR5GxoFhIAU&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) - I wanted to run through a basic HTML/CSS tutorial to make sure I wasn't missing any basic best practices. I found this one from Free Code Camp that Madison Kanna created. 
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - I hadn't used google fonts in a long time and enjoyed using it here
- [Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) - Cool site with lots of Front End coding challenges
